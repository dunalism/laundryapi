# Laundry Management API

This application is a RESTful API built with Express.js using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Each endpoint is protected by an authentication system and access permissions that vary based on the role, such as `owner`, `admin`, and `user`.

## Key Features

1. **Authentication** - Register and log in to the application.
2. **Product Management** - Restricted access for `owner` only.
3. **User Management** - Full access for `owner` and `admin` only.
4. **Customer and Transaction Management** - Limited access for `owner` and `admin`.
5. **User Profile** - Accessible by all authenticated users.

## API Documentation

For all endpoints that require authentication, you need to include the Bearer token in the headers. Hereâ€™s how to fetch data using JavaScript (fetch API).

```bash
// Example of a GET request with Bearer token
fetch('http://localhost:5000/api/v1/endpoint', {
    method: 'GET',
    headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN_HERE>' }
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data))
.catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));

```
