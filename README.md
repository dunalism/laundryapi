# Laundry Management API

This application is a RESTful API built with Express.js using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Each endpoint is protected by an authentication system and access permissions that vary based on the role, such as `owner`, `admin`, and `user`.

## Key Features

1. **Authentication** - Register and log in to the application.
2. **Product Management** - Restricted access for `owner` only.
3. **User Management** - Full access for `owner` and `admin` only.
4. **Customer and Transaction Management** - Limited access for `owner` and `admin`.
5. **User Profile** - Accessible by all authenticated users.

## Testing the Application with [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)

To simplify testing of the application, you can use postman by [importing](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/importing-data/) the available Postman collection and environment files. This will [set up](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/basics/navigating-postman/#environment-selector-and-variables-pane) all the endpoints and necessary variables for easier testing.

## API Documentation

For all endpoints that require authentication, you need to include the Bearer token in the headers. Hereâ€™s how to fetch data using JavaScript (fetch API).

```bash
// Example of a GET request with Bearer token
fetch('http://localhost:5000/api/v1/endpoint', {
    method: 'GET',
    headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN_HERE>' }
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data))
.catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));

```

### Important Note on Data Deletion

Since this application uses a relational database with foreign key constraints, please exercise caution when deleting users, customers, or products. If you delete a user, customer, or product that is associated with any transactions, those related transaction records will also be deleted due to the foreign key relationship. This may result in the loss of important transaction data.
